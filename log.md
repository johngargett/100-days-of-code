### Day 0: May 31, 2017

### Day 1: June 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started the actual FCC. In my hour, I got to "Create an Ordered List"

**Thoughts:** I have to watch for the niggly things like closing tags and semicolons at the end in stylesheets

### Day 2: June 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked for more than an hour tonight. I'm now at "Override Styles in Subsequent CSS"

**Thoughts**: The last challenge, Prioritize One Style Over Another, gave me fits until I found a missing }. I'm starting to see already that doing this every day is  going to help. It sticks better in my mind and I can do things without looking back.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
