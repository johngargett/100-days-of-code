# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 31, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started FreeCodeCamp (FCC), went through the intro and am ready to start coding.

### Day 1: June 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started the actual FCC. In my hour, I got to "Create an Ordered List"

**Thoughts:** I have to watch for the niggly things like closing tags and semicolons at the end in stylesheets

### Day 2: June 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked for more than an hour tonight. I'm now at "Override Styles in Subsequent CSS"

**Thoughts**: The last challenge, Prioritize One Style Over Another, gave me fits until I found a missing }. I'm starting to see already that doing this every day is  going to help. It sticks better in my mind and I can do things without looking back.

### Day 3: June 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Still working on @FreeCodeCamp. I'm at challenge "Add Font Awesome Icons to our Buttons"

**Thoughts** Again, the daily work is VERY helpful. The #100DaysOfCode seems to be just what I needed. Feeling much better about what I am learning. Making fewer mistakes.

### Day 4: June 4, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Still working on @FreeCodeCamp. I'm at challenge "Learn how Script Tags and Document Ready Work" I feel as though I'm making good time and progress as well as understanding.

**Thoughts:** Again, the daily work is VERY helpful. Got stuck on a few of the <div> closing tags but figured it out in time.

### Day 5: June 5, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Still working on @FreeCodeCamp. I'm further along. I think tomorrow I will have completed the challenges and be ready to start on the tribute page. 

**Thoughts:** I'm working steadily on the FCC and making good time.  

### Day 6: June 6, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished with the first part of the @FreeCodeCamp. Watched the video and am ready to start the tribute tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** Nearing the end of a section is exciting. I am looking forward to doing the tribute page. I'm going to use Thomas Alva Edison as my subject.

### Day 7: June 7, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Started work on the tribute. I spent 1 1/2 hours working on it and I have almost nothing to show. :(

**Thoughts:** This is super frustrating. I worked for 90 minutes and have almost nothing to show for it. I hope tomorrow is better. I may have to go back to the bootstrap section and re-read it.
