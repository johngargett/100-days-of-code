### Day 1: June 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started the actual FCC. In my hour, I got to "Create an Ordered List"

**Thoughts:** I have to watch for the niggly things like closing tags and semicolons at the end in stylesheets

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
